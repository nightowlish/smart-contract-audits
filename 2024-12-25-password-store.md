# 2. Protocol Summary

PasswordStore is a protocol dedicated to storage and retrieval of a user's passwords. The protocol is designed to be used by a single user. Only the owner should be able to set and access the password.

# 3. Disclaimer

Oana Asoltanei makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# 4. Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |

# 7. Findings

## 7.1. High
### 7.1.1. [HIGH-1] On-chain Data Visibility Allows Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information

**Description:**  
In the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, the private variable `PasswordStore::s_password` is used to store sensitive data. However, marking a variable as `private` in Solidity does not prevent it from being publicly accessible via blockchain storage. It only restricts direct access through Solidity-based function calls.

**Impact:**  
The password stored in the contract can be read directly from the blockchain by anyone, compromising the confidentiality of the data.

**Proof of Concept:**  
The following demonstrates how the password can be retrieved directly from blockchain storage using [Foundry's cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tool:

1. Start a local blockchain instance and allow it to keep running in the background:
```bash
anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the blockchain:
```bash
make deploy 
```

3. Retrieve the stored password:
Use the `cast storage` command to read the storage slot where the password is stored. In this case, the password is stored in slot `1`.
```bash
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
Example output:
`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

4. Decode the retrieved data into a human-readable string:
Use `cast parse-bytes32-string` to convert the hexadecimal output into its string representation.
```bash
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```
Output:
```bash
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords in plaintext on-chain. If it is necessary to store such data, ensure it is encrypted before storage. However, note that users would need to manage and remember the decryption key separately to access the encrypted data.

### 7.1.2. [HIGH-2] Missing Access Control Allows Unauthorized Users to Modify the Password

**Description:**  
The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function lacks access control mechanisms, allowing any user to invoke the function and modify the `PasswordStore::s_password` variable. This makes it possible for unauthorized users to overwrite the password set by the contract owner.

```javascript
function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
    // @audit - No access control implemented
    s_password = newPassword;
    emit SetNetPassword();
}
```

**Impact:** 
The absence of access control exposes the system to unauthorized access, enabling any user to overwrite the stored password, compromising the intended functionality and security of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**
The following test case demonstrates how an unauthorized user can modify the password:
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```javascript
    function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
        vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomAddress);
        string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
        assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
    }
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Implement access control in the PasswordStore::setPassword function to restrict its execution to the contract owner. For example:
```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```
This ensures that only the designated owner can modify the password, maintaining the integrity of the contract's functionality.

## 7.2. Medium

## 7.3. Low 

## 7.4. Informational
### 7.4.1. [INFO-1] Event Naming Convention Is Not Followed

**Description:**  
The event `PasswordStore::SetNetPassword()` does not adhere to the recommended naming convention for Solidity events. The standard convention suggests naming events in the format `<ContractName>__<EventName>` to clearly indicate the contract they belong to, enhancing traceability and readability during debugging and analysis.

**Impact:**  
Non-standard naming conventions can make debugging and contract analysis more challenging, especially when dealing with multiple contracts. It increases the time required to identify event origins during off-chain processing or on-chain event subscription.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Update the event name from `PasswordStore::SetNetPassword()` to `PasswordStore::PasswordStore__SetNetPassword()` to align with the recommended naming convention.

```solidity
// Rename the event to:
event PasswordStore__SetNetPassword();
```

### 7.4.2. [INFO-2] Incorrect NatSpec Parameter in `PasswordStorage::getPassword`

**Description:**  
The NatSpec documentation for the `PasswordStorage::getPassword` function incorrectly references a parameter `string newPassword`, which does not exist in the function signature. The actual function, `getPassword()`, does not accept any parameters, making the current documentation misleading.

**Impact:**  
Misinformation in NatSpec documentation can lead to confusion among developers or auditors who rely on it to understand the contractâ€™s behavior. This could result in errors or delays during contract interaction or code review.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Update the NatSpec documentation for the `getPassword` function by removing the incorrect parameter reference.

```diff
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
-     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
        if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
            revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
        }
        return s_password;
    }
```
